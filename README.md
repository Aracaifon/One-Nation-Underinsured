This paper is meant to explicate disparate nature of healthcare in the US, particularly in regards to its financing system and economic operations. The proposal is for Universal Health Care (UHC).
If anyone wants to take the time to convert the paper to AMA and make it look pretty, by all means go for it. Otherwise I'll get around to it eventually. I'm just too busy right now.
